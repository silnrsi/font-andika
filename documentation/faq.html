    <p>Here are a few of the most frequently asked questions
    specifically regarding Andika:</p>
    <h4 id="where-does-the-name-andika-come-from"><em>Where does the
    name Andika come from?</em></h4>
    <p>Andika — pronounced ahn-DEE-kah</p>
    <p>Swahili — spoken widely in eastern regions of the African
    continent, among other places.</p>
    <p>Meaning — ‘Write!’</p>
    <h4
    id="why-does-the-font-have-some-greek-characters-but-not-all"><em>Why
    does the font have some Greek characters, but not all?</em></h4>
    <p>Although Andika includes some Greek characters, it is not
    intended to provide general support for the Greek language. The
    Greek characters that are included are there to support various
    notational systems (linguistic, logical, mathematical). Other fonts,
    such as <a href="https://software.sil.org/gentium">Gentium Plus</a>,
    provide complete Greek script support.</p>
    <h4 id="will-you-add-full-greek-script-support"><em>Will you add
    full Greek script support?</em></h4>
    <p>We have no plans to do that. However, the <a
    href="https://scripts.sil.org/OFL_web">OFL licensing</a> allows
    anyone to add Greek support and freely distribute the font to
    others. It is even possible to <a href="developer.html">contribute
    that work back to the project</a> and share it with others.</p>
