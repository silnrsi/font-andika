    <p>Here are a few of the most frequently asked questions
    specifically regarding Andika:</p>
    <h4 id="where-does-the-name-andika-come-from"><em>Where does the
    name Andika come from?</em></h4>
    <p>Andika means ‘Write!’ in Swahili and is pronounced
    ahn-DEE-kah.</p>
    <h4 id="what-is-andika-six"><em>What is Andika Six?</em></h4>
    <p><a href="https://software.sil.org/andika/download/">Andika
    Six</a> is a separate font family that is a renamed version of
    Andika 6.200. The addition of kerning in Andika v7 may cause lines,
    paragraphs, and even pages to reflow. This will have minimal impact
    for most users, but if you need to retain the old spacing in
    documents install Andika Six and change the font in those documents
    to Andika Six. Then you can upgrade Andika to v7 and take advantage
    of the many improvements in the new version. Both Andika and Andika
    Six can be installed at the same time.</p>
    <h4 id="why-did-you-stop-producing-compact-versions"><em>Why did you
    stop producing Compact versions?</em></h4>
    <p>Improvements to both these fonts and industry font technology has
    reduced the need for <em>Compact</em> versions. If tight or loose
    line spacing is needed the best solution is to use the standard
    fonts and explicitly set the line spacing in your application. If
    the application does not allow user-specified line spacing the <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/lcgfonts/download/">v6.2 Compact
    fonts remain available</a>. Please also contact the app developer to
    request that they give users better control over line spacing.</p>
    <h4
    id="is-there-a-guide-to-the-many-versions-of-andika-and-its-variants"><em>Is
    there a guide to the many versions of Andika and its
    variants?</em></h4>
    <p>Yes! See the <a href="versions.html">Versions</a> page.</p>
    <h4
    id="why-does-my-application-not-show-the-bold-weight-in-font-menus-and-dialogs"><em>Why
    does my application not show the Bold weight in font menus and
    dialogs?</em></h4>
    <p>Some applications will list all the weights but leave out Bold.
    To access the Bold you need to choose Regular and turn on Bold using
    the application’s UI controls such as a “B” button. See our <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/axis-based-fonts/">Font Help
    Guide on Axis-Based Font Families</a> for more information.</p>
    <h4 id="why-do-i-sometimes-get-a-fake-bold"><em>Why do I sometimes
    get a fake Bold?</em></h4>
    <p>If you choose a weight other than Regular (such as Medium), and
    then use application controls to turn on Bold, some applications
    will make a “fake” Bold rather than use one of the real ones in the
    font (SemiBold, Bold). This is because only Regular has an
    associated Bold counterpart. This is a technical limitation with
    some apps and OSes. If you are using a weight other than Regular for
    text and want to make a word or phrase stand out, you will need to
    select the text and apply one of the heavier weights manually. See
    our <a href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/axis-based-fonts/">Font
    Help Guide on Axis-Based Font Families</a> for more information.</p>
    <h4 id="have-you-updated-the-andika-new-basic-fonts"><em>Have you
    updated the Andika New Basic fonts?</em></h4>
    <p>No. We no longer recommend or support Andika New Basic, or its
    predecessor, Andika Basic. These font families were based on the
    original Andika design, but with limited character set support.
    Andika includes support for all the characters and styles supported
    by the Basic fonts. The fonts remain available from the <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/andika/download/previous-versions/">Previous
    Versions archive</a>.</p>
    <h4
    id="why-are-the-basic-fonts-no-longer-supported-i-need-them-because-the-font-files-are-smaller-in-size-than-the-full-andika."><em>Why
    are the Basic fonts no longer supported? I need them because the
    font files are smaller in size than the full Andika.</em></h4>
    <p>Font size is less of a concern than when the Basic fonts were
    introduced in 2008. New compression technologies have also reduced
    the size of the fonts, particularly for web use. For example, Andika
    New Basic Regular (TrueType) was 310K and the WOFF version was 127K.
    The current Andika Regular (WOFF2)—which contains six times the
    glyphs—is only 290K. If you still feel that font size is a
    significant concern please <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/andika/about/contact/">contact
    us</a>. We may be able to point you to techniques that can reduce
    the size impact even further depending on your particular
    situation.</p>
    <h4
    id="why-does-the-font-have-some-greek-characters-but-not-all"><em>Why
    does the font have some Greek characters, but not all?</em></h4>
    <p>Although Andika includes some Greek characters, it is not
    intended to provide general support for the Greek language. The
    Greek characters that are included are there to support various
    notational systems (linguistic, logical, mathematical). Other fonts,
    such as <a href="https://software.sil.org/gentium">Gentium</a>,
    provide complete Greek script support.</p>
    <h4 id="will-you-add-full-greek-script-support"><em>Will you add
    full Greek script support?</em></h4>
    <p>We have no plans to do that. However, the <a
    href="https://openfontlicense.org/">OFL licensing</a> allows anyone
    to add Greek support and freely distribute the font to others. It is
    even possible to <a href="developer.html">contribute that work back
    to the project</a> and share it with others.</p>
