    <h2 id="announcement-list">Announcement list</h2>
    <p>If you would like stay informed of updates to Andika and other
    SIL fonts, please subscribe to the <a
    href="https://groups.google.com/a/groups.sil.org/forum/#!forum/sil-font-news">SIL
    Font News Announcement List</a>. For more information see <a
    href="about.html">About</a>.</p>
    <p>Our font announcements are also available through Twitter <a
    href="https://twitter.com/silfonts">@silfonts</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="current-versions">Current versions</h2>
    <p>The latest version of the fonts is always available from the <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/andika/download/">Andika download
    page</a> as a .zip archive for all major platforms.</p>
    <p>This font package is also available in the <a
    href="https://packages.sil.org/">SIL software repository for
    Ubuntu</a>. Users can subscribe to this software repository and get
    current versions and updates automatically.</p>
    <p>Andika is also available through the <a
    href="https://scripts.sil.org/ttw/fonts2go.cgi">TypeTuner Web</a>
    service, which allows you to choose among the smart font features
    and download a font with those features preset. TThis enables them
    to work in many applications that do not fully support OpenType.</p>
    <h2 id="special-purpose-modified-variants">Special-purpose modified
    variants</h2>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://software.sil.org/lcgfonts/download/">Modified
    versions of the fonts</a> are available that have been ‘tuned’ to
    turn on certain features by default. These are available for some
    regions and include <em>Literacy</em> and <em>Compact</em> versions.
    <strong>These remain at version 6.101 and have not been updated to
    version 6.200. They will be updated at the next major version (7).
    If you need any of the new features or characters in this version,
    but also need them supported in the special-purpose modified fonts,
    please contact us.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="version-5-subsets">Version 5 subsets</h2>
    <p>Special versions of Andika version 5 were created for specific
    uses. Those fonts still work and remain available:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://software.sil.org/lcgfonts/font-subsets/">Font
    subsets</a> are limited versions of the fonts that support only the
    characters needed for a particular area or use. Subsets are
    available for Africa, Americas, Asia/Pacific, Europe/Eurasia,
    Vietnam, Phonetic, Cyrillic (Basic) and Cyrillic Extended. With the
    exception of the Phonetic font, the font subsets are intended for
    orthographic use only. We have not put anything in the other subsets
    for phonetic, transliteration, or transcription use. For those
    purposes, use the Phonetic subset.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not intend to update these fonts to version 6, however they
    should continue to work. <strong>If you have a need for any of these
    fonts to be updated to version 6, please <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/andika/about/contact/">contact
    us</a>.</strong></p>
    <h2 id="previous-versions">Previous versions</h2>
    <p>Previous versions remain available from our <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/andika/download/previous-versions">Previous
    Versions archive</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="change-history">Change history</h2>
    <p>A detailed list of changes for each version of the fonts is on
    the <a href="history.html">Version history page</a>.</p>
