Here are a few of the most frequently asked questions specifically regarding Andika:

#### *Where does the name Andika come from?*

Andika — pronounced ahn-DEE-kah

Swahili — spoken widely in eastern regions of the African continent, among other places.

Meaning — ‘Write!’

#### *Why does the font have some Greek characters, but not all?*

Although Andika includes some Greek characters, it is not intended to provide general support for the Greek language. The Greek characters that are included are there to support various notational systems (linguistic, logical, mathematical). Other fonts, such as [Gentium Plus](https://software.sil.org/gentium), provide complete Greek script support. 

#### *Will you add full Greek script support?*

We have no plans to do that. However, the [OFL licensing](https://scripts.sil.org/OFL_web) allows anyone to add Greek support and freely distribute the font to others. It is even possible to [contribute that work back to the project](developer.md) and share it with others.
