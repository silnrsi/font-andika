        <h1 class="title">Andika - Version 7 Changes</h1>
    </header>
    <h2 id="new-major-release">New major release</h2>
    <p>Andika version 7 is a major release with many new additions,
    enhancements, and improvements. This is a summary of the most
    notable changes and what you need to know if you have been using
    earlier versions. <strong>Please read this carefully to understand
    the major changes.</strong> For further details on these changes,
    particularly regarding individual characters, see <a
    href="history.html">Version history</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="family-structure">Family structure</h2>
    <h3 id="additional-intermediate-weights">Additional intermediate
    weights</h3>
    <p>Andika now has additional intermediate weights. Previously
    existing weights have not changed. Here is a list, with retained
    weights in <strong>bold</strong> and new weights in <em>italic</em>.
    The CSS values for the weights within each family are in
    parentheses. Italic faces follow a similar structure and
    correspondence. - <strong>Andika Regular</strong> (400) - <em>Andika
    Medium</em> (500) - <em>Andika SemiBold</em> (600) - <strong>Andika
    Bold</strong> (700)</p>
    <p>The new intermediate weights in this extended, axis-based family
    can be confusing for applications that still assume families should
    have only four members (Regular, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic). This is
    the case for Microsoft Word and some older Windows applications. For
    details on how to use the intermediate weights in these
    applications, see <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/axis-based-fonts/">Using
    Axis-Based Font Families</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="no-compact-versions">No Compact versions</h3>
    <p>The v7 fonts do not have <em>Compact</em> variants. If you
    <em>Compact</em> fonts, and your application does not allow explicit
    control over line spacing, you can continue to use the <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/lcgfonts/download/">v6.2 Andika
    Compact fonts</a>, which remain available. <strong>If you need any
    of the new v7 features or characters, but also need them supported
    in a compact version please <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/andika/about/contact/">contact
    us</a>. We continue to recommend that you set line spacing
    explicitly in your document styles and preferences, and adjust it as
    needed for your particular situation.</strong></p>
    <p>TypeTuner Web no longer offers line spacing alternatives for the
    v7 fonts (Normal, Tight, Loose). If you need Tight or Loose variants
    the v6.2 fonts remain available and support line spacing
    alternatives.</p>
    <h3
    id="special-purpose-modified-variants-have-not-been-updated-to-v7">Special-purpose
    modified variants have not been updated to v7</h3>
    <p>In previous versions, special-purpose modified font variants were
    available that had been ‘pre-tuned’ to turn on certain features by
    default for some regional and special uses. These are not available
    for the v7 fonts, however, the <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/lcgfonts/download/">v6.2
    special-purpose fonts are still available</a>. <strong>If you need
    any of the new features or characters in this version, but also need
    them supported in the special-purpose modified fonts please <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/andika/about/contact/">contact
    us</a>.</strong></p>
    <p>Note that even in version 7 the special-purpose alternates can be
    manually preset with TypeTuner Web. The only change to this is that
    the 'pre-tuned' versions (only) remain at version 6.2.</p>
    <h2 id="new-features-and-character-support">New features and
    character support</h2>
    <h3 id="greatly-enhanced-kerning">Greatly enhanced kerning</h3>
    <p>Kerning has now been add to cover the full range of alphabetic
    symbols, including small caps. To make this practically useful for a
    wide range of languages the letters have been clustered into overly
    generalized groups. This enables the kerning to apply to more
    combinations, but does not allow for careful fine-tuning. The
    expanded kerning may not be ideal in all cases, and may still
    require manual adjustment, but it should provide improved spacing
    compared with previous versions. It is very possible that we have
    made some mistakes in this massive kerning effort, so please <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/andika/about/contact/">contact us</a>
    if you encounter any combinations whose spacing has been made worse
    than in v6.2.</p>
    <p><strong>Warning: Because of the addition of extensive kerning,
    line, paragraph, and page lengths may be different from
    v6.2.</strong></p>
    <h3 id="diagonal-6-9-feature-split-into-two">Diagonal 6 &amp; 9
    feature split into two</h3>
    <p>The OpenType feature for alternate versions of 6 and 9 with
    diagonal stems has been split into two separate features. The
    previously existing feature (<code>cv06</code>) now only affects the
    numeral 6. A new feature (<code>cv09</code>) affects only the
    numeral 9. See the <a href="features.html">Feature list</a>.</p>
    <h3
    id="additional-character-support-including-unicode-16">Additional
    character support including Unicode 16</h3>
    <p>Support has been added for 29 additional characters, some of
    which were introduced in Unicode 16. For a full list see <a
    href="history.html">Version history</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="general-improvements">General improvements</h2>
    <p>Other improvements have been made to over 150 glyphs, OpenType
    code, and other font aspects, including:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Central European carons have improved designs and kerning.</li>
    <li>Bridging diacritics handle many more possible combinations. See
    <a href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/bridging-diacritics/">Using
    Bridging Diacritics</a> for details on how these need to be encoded
    and ordered.</li>
    <li>Small caps apply to bracketing punctuation.</li>
    <li>Autohinting is more consistent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more details see <a href="history.html">Version
    history</a>.</p>

    suggestions on how we can make the fonts better, please <a
