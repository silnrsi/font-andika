    <p>Andika is a sans serif, Unicode-compliant font designed
    especially for literacy use, taking into account the needs of
    beginning readers. The focus is on clear, easy-to-perceive
    letterforms that will not be readily confused with one another.</p>
    <p>A sans serif font is preferred by some literacy personnel for
    teaching people to read. Its forms are simpler and less cluttered
    than those of most serif fonts. For years, literacy workers have had
    to make do with fonts that were not really suitable for beginning
    readers and writers. In some cases, literacy specialists have had to
    tediously assemble letters from a variety of fonts in order to get
    all of the characters they need for their particular language
    project, resulting in confusing and unattractive publications.
    Andika addresses those issues.</p>
    <p><em>Andika provides clear, simply designed letters.</em> This
    facilitates letter recognition, a skill second only to
    distinguishing sounds in learning to read. Some fonts have letters
    that look like mirror images of each other, which for a new reader
    can be confusing. Andika gives those similar letters distinct
    characteristics to reduce confusion. The differences are so small
    that most people would not notice them, but those small differences
    give the brain a little help. We also applied these differentiation
    techniques throughout all of the hundreds and thousands of glyphs in
    the font, so that even those writing systems that use rare symbols
    can benefit.</p>
    <p>Some of the things requested by literacy specialists over the
    years are addressed in Andika:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>sans serif design (no ‘little feet’ on the letters)</li>
    <li>lower case ‘a’ and ‘g’ that look more like handwriting (also
    known as ‘single-story’ shapes)</li>
    <li>capital i, lower case l, and numeral 1 that don’t look
    alike</li>
    <li>lower case r which, when followed by n, doesn’t look like m</li>
    <li>diacritics (accent marks) that are large enough to recognize,
    and which position themselves properly</li>
    <li>letter shapes to fit local preferences. Some parts of the world
    use a y with no curved tail, for example, or a 7 with a crossbar.
    These are just two of the optional letter shapes available</li>
    </ul>
