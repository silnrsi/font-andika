Andika Six
==========

This is Andika Six, a separate branch of Andika.

Andika Six is simply a renamed version of Andika v6.200 with no other changes. Andika version 7 will include metrics changes that could cause lines, paragraphs, and pages to reflow. Because of this we wanted to provide a font that reproduced the exact metrics and behavior of Andika v6.200 and could be installed at the same time as the newest Andika (v7 and beyond). Once released, Andika v7 will be the best font for most people to use. But if you have documents that you prepared with Andika v6.200 you can install Andika Six, change the doc to use it instead of Andika, and avoid any issues with reflow. Then you can use Andika v7 for new documents and benefit from the many improvements in that and future versions.

This project is intended to provide a free and open font family for all current languages and writing systems that use Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek scripts. It supports almost the complete range of Unicode characters for these scripts, including a comprehensive range of diacritics and a large set of symbols useful for linguistics and literacy work. Smart font routines automatically adjust the position of diacritics to support and optimize arbitrary base+diacritic combinations. This project uses a UFO-based design and production workflow, with all sources in open formats and a completely open-source build toolkit.
